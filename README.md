Description of the Web Scraping Scripts
This project features two web scraping scripts designed to extract structured data from
online sources, providing insights into trending music and book availability.
The first script, "Billboard Top 100 Songs Scraper", extracts information from the
Billboard Hot 100 chart. It collects the rank, title, and artist for each song listed on
the chart. The data is saved in both .csv and .txt formats for ease of use and analysis.
This script demonstrates the ability to work with dynamic web pages to gather the latest
trends in the music industry.
The second script, "Books Info Scraper", focuses on the website "Books to Scrape," a
static platform ideal for learning web scraping fundamentals. It retrieves details such
as title, price, and availability of books listed on the site. The scraped data is stored
in a .txt file, providing a straightforward way to assess book pricing and availability.
Both scripts utilize Python libraries, including requests for sending HTTP requests and
BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. These implementations showcase efficient data extraction
techniques, enabling users to automate information retrieval and organize data in
structured formats. The project is versatile and demonstrates practical applications of
web scraping for e-commerce and entertainment industries.
